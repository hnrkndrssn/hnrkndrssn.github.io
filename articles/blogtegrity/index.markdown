Intro
-----

This is a promise that the contents of this blog under my control are
genuine, truthful, and honest to the best of my knowledge. The obvious
exception is of course any satire I may write, which will be downright
dishonest and impure in thought.

Independent
-----------

At its root, the purpose of this statement is to lay the claim that this
blog represents an independent opinion beholden to no other interests
other than my own. Any time I write about something that might represent
a conflict of interest, I will make such conflicts clear.

Comments
--------

I cannot vouch for the comments left by others. I generally leave those
in unless I believe them to be SPAM or completely off topic (as in
comment graffiti).

Endorsements and Advertising
----------------------------

I will not personally endorse a product, company, or service that I
haven’t personally experienced and believe in. At times, I may mention
that so-and-so, a trusted person recommends something, but I will not
endorse that product or service unless I have tried it out myself.

I may partake in viral marketing once in a while, but usually only as a
favor or in response to a personal friend. And, as I stated before, I
will make sure any such participation is clearly noted. I am not going
to take part in subterfuge.

Mistakes
--------

Lastly, I reserve the right to occasionally make mistakes in regards to
this promise. However I promise to promptly and noticeably correct any
mistakes brought to my attention and have no problem admitting them.

Oh, and if I make any significant changes to this promise (apart from
fixing typos, grammar, etc...), I’ll be sure to mention it in my blog.
